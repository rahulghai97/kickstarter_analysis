				Kickstarter Challenge: Written Analysis

Overview of the project:
In this project, we aim to help Louise crowdfund her play, "Fever", with a budget of $10,000. In this module we used Excel to sort through and analyze crowdfunding data to see if there are specific factors that affect these types of projects, and how Louise can use these to set her project up for success.  

Analysis and Challenge Questions

I didn’t have many difficulties, my biggest one is that the final chart for Outcomes Based on Goals chart is different, but I’ve gone through my data and it seems to fit it correctly. Potential difficulties are having too many filters on and the data doesn’t portray the picture you are looking for. The data can also be in a wrong format, I accidentally originally charted the date launched without converting it to the short date and it gave me a completely different graph.

As a brief general analysis, to look at the data and the type of event that Louise is hosting, we see that theater and plays are generally more successful than unsuccessful. 





Results:
Looking at the data for outcomes based on launch date, we see that in almost every month there are more successful than failed theater events. With that being said, from April to May there is the largest difference between the two and there are many more successful than failed ones. We also see that regardless of the month, canceled events are low with none in October.
 

Looking at Outcomes vs goals (my chart appears to be a bit different), once the goal passes ~$5,000, most events are relatively successful with failed staying around 5-15% and canceled staying below 10%. So the only real relationship seen is that once goal hits above 5k,  they are reasonably achievable.
 

Limitations
Given Louise’s budget of $10,000, production costs definitely should be factored into this when comparing events, especially between plays. More money could mean bigger venue and marketing, attracting more donations. Country can also be too broad; Louise maybe should have narrowed it to city. Another graph that might help, to narrow it down even more would be genre of the play. Another limitation might be that goal should be expressed as a percentage of production budget, as seen in the relationship above higher goals are much more achievable. Assuming that higher goals come with bigger productions, it can influence the results. Overall Louise should pursue this as it looks achievable.
